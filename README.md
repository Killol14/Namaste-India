## User Experience

* User Stories

Pspective visitors 

I created this website for families and potential visitors and first Time Travelling to TheIndia, as I couldn’t find a website that contained the information for the firsttime Travelling to india and wants know before travelling to the India. 



I also believe that visitors who wish to ask more questions about the India befor they travel as I have created a contact form to submit with any questions and also I have created a Package Guide form where they can find out estimated price for travelling to India.

## Design 

For the Main title page of The Namste India website, (H1) I used "Josefin Slabas" the main font. This is a clear and simplistic font enabling Viewers of the website see clearly the topic of the website.  I also Used Same Font "Josefin Slab" throughout the wwebsite as seems like its more related font with Indian culture.


 

## Colour Scheme  

Used RGB throughout.  

I chose this colour scheme, as the website is based around Nature, the Green and beige colour scheme match with the nature tones of the topic of the website.  

* Black
* Olive
* FF0000
* FF4500
* CFB21F
* 9ACD32

![Park Colour Scheme](images/README.img/colour.PNG)

## Images  

As this website is based on an area of Natural Beauty, I have included images of the park in order to show the diverse aesthetic of the park.  

The front page has carousel images in order to give a snapshot of the park.  

I have also added extra pictures to each subheading on the website to give a visualization of the attractions situated in the park.  

The website contains border radius throughout for the images to make them more striking and visually appealing 

I have also added a link to a gallery section, in order to give the reader more of an idea of the beauty of the park.  

 

## Icons  

I used the social media on the footer Icons, which are located on the footer from, Font Awesome.  

 

## Structure  

 

### Navigation Bar  

The navigation bar is Static and is sticky, so the user can refer back to the links at the top at any point.  

I have added the navigation bar on the all other page so its easy to navigate.

### Carousel card and JsFlipster

For the carouse card image for gallery I have used the Bootstrap 4.5 and 7 ,
for the Jsflipster I have Copyed the link and some code from one of the YouTube Guide Video.

### Hyperlinks  

I have included Hyperlinks on the webpage to allow the user to go straight to different websites where external companies provide more details about the events/restaurants/Opening times to get more information.  

### Map  

I have included a Map, for information on location and also to show the scale of the park.  
Map is Also created with the javascript.

 

#### LightHouse Images

gallery2 Is created with LightHouse-plus-Jquery.js 



 

### Social Media Links (Footer) 

This includes the icons which take the user to the relevant social media page  

This code was sourced from Code Institute’s Bootstrap CV project 

 

 ## Features  

 

### Current Features  

I have created a website that is fully responsive on all screen sizes eg Tablet Mobile Laptop, by using the Bootsrap grid system. This allows the texts and images to translate properly on these devices.  

 

### Interactive Elements  

I have included a hover function on the gallery tab to enable users to zoom in on the pictures.  

I have also added a Map to the bottom page of the website in order for uses to see the scale of the park and the different car parks/entrances and location.

## Summary 

This website was created as, I noticed when researching ideas for this project, that there was no specific website dedicated to the park. Only the pages on the Birmingham City Council Website were the only information I could find; however, this was just text and no pictures and not overly informative.  

I believe I have a created a website that shows the natural beauty of the park, with stunning visual imagery and links to activities, nature and restaurants.
