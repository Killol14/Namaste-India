        Generally speaking, the best time of year to go to India is between October and March, with much of the country dry, 
        sunny and pleasantly warm. That said, it’s unwise to generalise about anything when you travel to India, and certainly not the weather. 
        In December you can bask on Kerala’s beaches or boil at the Taj Mahal, yet in the Ladakh mountains temperatures plummet to the minus teens.
        Much of India experiences a tumultuous monsoon season from July until September, but the sun can be shining in northern India.
        And you can hike in Kerala’s Western Ghats in winter, but head to the Himalayas and it’s skis, boots and crampons.

        <h4>What is the best time to visit the Golden Triangle in India?</h4>
        <!--Text Is copy and past from one of the Travel Site-->
    <p class="p">The best time to visit the Golden Triangle is <span>between October and mid-April,</span> between October and mid-April, when you can expect temperatures around 22-32°C. 
        Note that December, January and February can be foggy and cold, however. Given that this iconic route linking the treasures of Delhi, 
        Agra and Jaipur often involves a fair bit of walking, 
        you’ll want to explore it before the heatwave of May and June, and the soaking monsoon season that follows afterwards.</p>

         With mountain train journeys, tiger safaris, backwater houseboats, drinking out of coconuts, 
        camel rides in the desert and a culture that is so vibrant they will feel as if they are part of a movie set, 
        travelling in India with kids is one of the most eye opening trips you will take as a family.
        Simple things like their first trip in a tuk tuk will be a memory for life. As will playing cricket with the children at your homestay. 
        The welcome for families is just phenomenal. As with travel anywhere in the world,
        when you have kids, the door is usually opened wide but in India it is flung open with fervent excitement.

            India’s history stretches much further back than the colonial tea plantations and hill towns.
             If you go on a cultural tour of Rajasthan you will enter the world of princes and palaces, 
             soaking up the luxurious lives led by Maharana, Maharajahs, Nawabs and Rajkumars going back centuries. 
             If you want to feel 'to the manor born' you can visit them via luxury overnight trains, such as the Maharajas’ Express.
             The other major architectural influences are from the Mughal period in India, the most famous being the Taj Mahal, of course, as well as the Agra Fort, 
             the fort-city of Fatehpur Sikri and the Red Fort in Delhi - all part of the Golden Triangle. For Buddhist influences, 
             head to Ladakh with temples and shrines enveloped by the region’s dramatic peaks. For some of the finest Hindu temples,
             Tamil Nadu is an unexpected treat where you are not only given access to temples but also the Hindu dance of Theyyam which takes part in them.

            There can be few things more frustrating than when a tourist goes into a restaurant in India and complains that there is no korma on the menu. The chefs must want to take out a giant map of the country, 
            label the regions and their culinary influences and then point out that korma is in fact from a Mughal tradition, emanating from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Northern India.
            The map of Indian food is as varied as its landscapes, cultures and historical influences. One thing that is common throughout all of India, however, is the cultural importance of food.
            How it has been influenced by colonists, religion, spice traders and of course, the climate. And most importantly, the culture of eating together as a family or with friends is what makes the culinary experience in India most delicious of all.
